# JDBC connector

The `jdbc` source is bounded and can synchronize one or more tables in one offline job. It does not poll for changes or
implement CDC. Configure
`table_list` with table objects for a multi-table job; each emitted batch keeps its source table identity so the JDBC
sink can create and write the matching target table.

```hocon
source {
  type = "jdbc"
  url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/flux_test"
  table_list = [
    { table_path = "flux_test.user_info" },
    { table_path = "flux_test.orders" }
  ]
}

sink {
  type = "jdbc"
  url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/flux_test"
  # `table` is an alias for `table_path`.
  table = "sink_${schema_name}_${table_name}"
}
```

The sink expands `${table_name}` with the source table name. `${schema_name}`
uses the source schema; for MySQL's `database.table` paths it uses the database name. A fixed `table` value, such
as `public.sink_table`, writes all input to that target. If `table`/`table_path` is configured, Flux generates the
INSERT/UPSERT SQL for the resolved target and ignores `custom_sql`/`query`.

## Options

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | yes | — | JDBC connection URL. |
| `table_path` | one of `table_path` or `table_list` | — | Source table path. |
| `table_list` | one of `table_path` or `table_list` | — | List of `{ table_path = "..." }` source-table objects. |
| `query` | no | — | SQL query to read for a single table; requires `table_path`. |
| `username` | no | empty | JDBC user name. |
| `password` | no | empty | JDBC password. |
| `driver` | no | — | JDBC driver class to load before connecting. |
| `fetch_size` | no | `1000` | JDBC fetch size used while reading. |
| `read_consistency` | no | `BEST_EFFORT` | Read consistency: `BEST_EFFORT`, `SINGLE_CONNECTION_SNAPSHOT`, or a dialect-provided `DATABASE_SNAPSHOT`. |

The result columns retain their query order and use JDBC column labels as the
`FluxRow` field names.

## Partitioned reads

`partition_column`, `partition_lower_bound`, `partition_upper_bound`, and `partition_num` split a table into
deterministic, non-overlapping ranges. Numeric columns use `FixedChunkSplitter`; fixed-width ASCII keys
use `AsciiStringRangeSplitter`. The final range is upper-bound inclusive, so no boundary row is lost. Partition bounds
are required deliberately: this bounded source does not issue an unbounded `MIN`/`MAX` analysis query during planning.

## Execution parallelism

Configure job-level reader concurrency outside the connector configuration:

```hocon
env {
  parallelism = 4
}
```

The launcher creates at most `parallelism` source readers and assigns every split to one reader exactly once. JDBC uses
this value while planning range splits, so an unspecified `partition_num` produces no more than this many chunks per
table. Batches from different tables or ranges can be read concurrently, while the local sink remains single-threaded
because the current `SinkWriter` owns one transactional JDBC connection and is not safe to share across writers.

### Read consistency

`BEST_EFFORT` is the default and preserves the existing parallel reader behavior. With more than one source reader,
separate JDBC connections can observe different database snapshots; the connector emits a preparation-time warning
without connection credentials or tokens.

`SINGLE_CONNECTION_SNAPSHOT` requires `env.parallelism = 1`. The reader configures its JDBC connection as read-only,
disables auto-commit, and requests repeatable-read isolation before reading. It is available only when the selected JDBC
dialect declares support.

`DATABASE_SNAPSHOT` is reserved for dialects that can coordinate one database snapshot across multiple readers. The
built-in MySQL dialect does not implement it yet, so preparation fails before any source task is created.

For string keys, configure a fixed-width ASCII column using a binary/ASCII-compatible database collation. Locale-aware
and variable-width strings are not safe range keys.
